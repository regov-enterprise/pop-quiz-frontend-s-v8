#### Question 1

Sales inventory management is very time consuming by manual process. A system that manages these processes would increases efficiency and productivity. 

Build an MVP app for sales inventory management with the following requirements:

- User authentication: The app should have a user authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and reset their passwords.
- Profile management: The app should allow users to update their profiles, including their names, email addresses, and profile pictures.
- Social media integration: The app should allow users to sign in using their social media accounts and share app content on social media platforms.
- Multi-language support: The app should be designed to support multiple languages and be easily translatable into different languages

Overall, the project should be designed to provide a high-quality and user-friendly mobile app using React Native or React.

#### Notes

- Use React | ReactNative (Tpypescript)
- Apply your preferred coding practice and style
- Unit test is an added advantage
- Add README 
- Be free to make decisions on the type of data to collect
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)
